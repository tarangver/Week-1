Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship presented by Edunet Foundation, in collaboration with AICTE &amp; Shell, focusing on Green Skills using AI technologies.

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into different categories based on their type or characteristics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model processes image data to identify and categorize plastic waste such as bottles, bags, or other materials, facilitating effective waste management. The project aims to aid in recycling efforts by automating waste sorting, enhancing efficiency, and reducing human intervention in the process. It also contributes to environmental sustainability by promoting better plastic waste handling and recycling practices.
